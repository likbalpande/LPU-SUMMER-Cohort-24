1. We understood how client-server works
2. We started with NodeJS
    i. Made one function and exported it. Then imported it 
        and used the function. (Name does not mattered)
    ii. Made multiple functions and exported/imported them as array.
        That time position / index mattered.
    iii. Made multiple functions and exported/imported them as object.
        That time name mattered.

    Till now we made our custom modules. Now we started using third party modules.

    iv. npm init -y
        to initialize node package

    v. we installed figlet / dependency with the help of npmjs
    vi. we used the figlet / dependency. (Code was refereed from documentation)
